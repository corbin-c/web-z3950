# web-z3950

This tool is a binding to access [Z39.50 protocol](https://www.niso.org/publications/ansiniso-z3950-2003-s2014)
over HTTP. It is a proof-of-concept of using NodeJS to perform Z39.50 requests
with [IndexData's Yaz-client](https://www.indexdata.com/resources/software/yaz/)
and to serve the resulting Marc records.
